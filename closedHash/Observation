According to my code on Quadratic and Double Hashing probing these are my below observations:

1. The 5 data files have different load factors which obviously increased with every increment of data:
	data1.txt	LF = 0.18 for both Quadratic and Double Hashing
	data2.txt	LF = 0.33 for both Quadratic and Double Hashing
	data3.txt	LF = 0.52 for both Quadratic and Double Hashing
	data4.txt	LF = 0.67 for both Quadratic and Double Hashing
	data5.txt	LF = 0.86 for both Quadratic and Double Hashing

2. I was able to insert always for the first two data files ie. when LF is 0.18 and 0.33. 
	But Insertion failed for some cases in the remaining three data files i.e when LF is 0.52, 0.67 and 0.86.

   This support our corollary as well
	COROLLARY: 
	When m is prime and the table is at least half-empty; i.e., 
	LF < 1/2, we can always insert a new item into 
	a closed hash table using quadratic probing.

3. Obviously from the above observations we can conclude that Quadratic or Double hashing(open addressing schemes) outperforms 
   hashing with chaining only if implemented correctly ie considering a prime no always for m(table size) and a Load Factor always
   less than 1/2.
